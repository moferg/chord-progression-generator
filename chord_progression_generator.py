# Chord Progression Generator - Marshall Ferguson - 7/2020

# TODO - Ask user if they want a major or minor chord progression

# TODO - Ask user how many chords they want in the progression

# TODO - Create a function that generates a chord progression based on user input
    # EG - if user asks for a 4 chord progression in a major key, the program outputs something like "I IV V I" or "I ii vii I"
